# Image xray app

This is a Streamlit app to visualize the intermediate activations of a convolutional autoencoder trained on a mystery dataset. 

You can take it as a challenge to discover something about the dataset from the provided weights, or just run your images through it. I find it really cool. `A E S T H E T I C S` and all that.

Using other kinds of CNN models is not supported at all, but not too difficult.
